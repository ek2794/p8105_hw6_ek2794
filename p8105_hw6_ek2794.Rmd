##Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.##

Here we read in the data and filter out the cities Dallas, Phoenix, Kansas, and Tulsa. We further filtered this dataset to include only black or white races and selected the relevant variables. For the Baltimore dataframe, we filtered out Baltimore city from the overall dataset.


```{r}
website = ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")

crimes_df = read_csv(website) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  unite(city_state, c(city, state), sep = ", ")  %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & 
           city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & 
           city_state != "Kansas City, MO" &
           city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") %>%
  mutate(
    resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex) %>%
  filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") 

      
baltimore_df = crimes_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
      
```


##For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.##

Here we created a logistic regression with the outcome of resolved crime and predictor variables of victim age, sex, and race. We mutated the outcomes to create an odds ratio (exponentiated the estimate), and calculated out the confidence intervals. 

```{r}

baltimore_model =
  baltimore_df %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         OR_conf_low = exp(OR - 1.96*(std.error)),
         OR_conf_high = exp(OR + 1.96*(std.error))) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, OR_conf_low, OR_conf_high) 

```


##Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.##

Here we applied the logistic regressiom model to the rest of the dataset, initially by nesting the dataset and ultimately unnesting the results. Similary, the varibles of odds ratio and confidence intervals were calculated out with the mutate function. 

```{r}
cities_results = 
  crimes_df %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>%
  mutate(
    models = map(.x = data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
    mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
           OR_conf_low = exp(estimate - 1.96*(std.error)),
         OR_conf_high = exp(estimate + 1.96*(std.error))) %>%
  select(city_state, OR, OR_conf_low, OR_conf_high) 
```


##Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city. Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.##

Here we use the ggplot function to plot out the odds ratios with the error bars demonstrating the confidence interval. Using the 'fct_reorder' function, the cities are arranged in ascending odds ratios. 
```{r}
cities_results %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = OR_conf_low, ymax = OR_conf_high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```



##PROBLEM 3##

##In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the effects of several variables on a child’s birthweight. This dataset, available here, consists of roughly 4000 children and includes the following variable.##

##Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).##

Here we read in the csv file, cleaned out the variables with NA, and made the numeric variables into numeric values.

```{r}
birthweight_df = read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(
    bhead = as.numeric(bhead),
    blength = as.numeric(blength),
    bwt = as.numeric(bwt),
    delwt = as.numeric(delwt),
    fincome = as.numeric(fincome),
    gaweeks = as.numeric(gaweeks),
    menarche = as.numeric(menarche),
    mheight = as.numeric(mheight),
    momage = as.numeric(momage),
    parity = as.numeric(parity),
    pnumlbw = as.numeric(pnumlbw),
    ppbmi = as.numeric(ppbmi),
    ppwt = as.numeric(ppbmi),
    ppwt = as.numeric(ppwt),
    wtgain = as.numeric(wtgain))
```


##Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two. Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making this plot.##


Here I created a regression model with the variables gestational age in weeks, mom's age, baby's head circumference, and baby's length at birth. I chose these GA as premies are often underwent, mom's age as younger age of mothers are known to be associated with low birth weight, baby's head circumference as preserved head growth is different from proportionally small head circumference in terms of etiology of small size, and baby's length as shorter babies would likely weigh less. 
```{r}
bw_fit1 = birthweight_df %>%
  lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + momage + bhead + blength, data = . )
 
bw_fit1 %>%
  broom::glance()

summary(bw_fit1)

birthweight_df %>%
  modelr::add_residuals(bw_fit1) %>%
  modelr::add_predictions(bw_fit1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + geom_point()
```


##Compare your model to two others:##

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)
```{r}
bw_fit2 = birthweight_df %>%
  lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = . )

bw_fit2 %>%
  broom::glance()

summary(bw_fit2)
```

One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these

```{r}
bw_fit3 = birthweight_df %>%
  lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = . )

bw_fit3 %>%
  broom::glance()

summary(bw_fit3)
```

##Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.##

Using the crossv_mc function, we created a training and a test dataset. Here we also fit the models and obtained RMSEs using the mutate, map, and map2 functions. From the violin plots, you can see the the first model is likely the best fit followed by model 3. Model 2 has the highest residuals so appears to be the poorest fit. 

```{r}
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight_df, 100) %>%
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)
  )

cv_df = 
  cv_df %>%
  mutate(
    bw_fit1 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + momage + bhead + blength, data =.x)),
    bw_fit2 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data =.x)),
    bw_fit3 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data =.x))) %>%
  mutate(
    rmse_fit1 = map2_dbl(bw_fit1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_fit2 = map2_dbl(bw_fit2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_fit3 = map2_dbl(bw_fit3, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

cv_df %>%
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>%
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
  
```



Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect your model to be “optimal”.
